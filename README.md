</div>

We benchmark MiroFlow on a series of benchmarks including **GAIA**, **HLE**, **BrowseComp** and **xBench-DeepSearch**. Meantime, we are working on more benchmarks.

| Model/Framework | GAIA Val | HLE | HLE-Text | BrowserComp-EN | BrowserComp-ZH | xBench-DeepSearch |
|----------------|----------|-----|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **MiroFlow** | **82.4%** | 27.2% | **29.5%** | 33.2% | **47.1%** | **72.0%** |

### GAIA-Validation

<img src="docs/figs/gaia_score.png" width="40%" alt="GAIA Validation Performance" align="right">

MiroFlow **achieved 81.8% pass@3, 82.4% maj. vote, 74.5% pass@1 (best@3), and 72.2% pass@1 (avg@3) on the GAIA validation set**. This represents **state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance** among open-source agent frameworks.

> [!NOTE]
> Our pass@1 scores are reported as both the average across three runs (avg@3) and the best score among those runs (best@3). For most other reported pass@1 results, it is unclear whether they represent an average or a best score across multiple trials (indicated with *). 

To prevent agents from retrieving answers directly from Hugging Face, we disabled access to it during the inference and trace collection.

*We have evaluated multiple agent frameworks on GAIA. Please note that some reported results may be overstated or lack clear definitions, and are not reproducible.*
In contrast, reproducing MiroFlow's results is straightforward with just a few required API keys.


# ü§ñ MiroFlow: Modular AI Agent Framework

MiroFlow is a high-performance, modular framework for building intelligent AI agents that achieve state-of-the-art results on complex benchmarks. It features multi-turn conversation capabilities, comprehensive tool integration, and hierarchical sub-agent support for superior task completion.

# üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
> [!TIP]
> we recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) with `python>= 3.12` 

### Step 1: Clone repo and prepare python environment

```bash
## clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MiroMindAI/MiroFlow
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent

## prepare python environment
uv sync
```

### Step 2: Set up environment variables

#### a. Set up `MiroFlow/apps/prepare-benchmark/.env`

```bash
## copy environment variable template and prepare yours in .env file
cd MiroFlow/apps/prepare-benchmark

# Edit .env with your actual API keys
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure environment variables:

```env
# For downloading datasets from Hugging Face
HF_TOKEN="<your-huggingface-token>"

# [Optional] Data loading directory, by default `../../data`
DATA_DIR="../../data" # relative to this file 
```

#### b. Set up `MiroFlow/apps/run-agent/.env`

```bash
## copy environment variable template and prepare yours in .env file
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent

# Edit .env with your actual API keys
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure environment variables:

```env
# Using OpenRouter to provide primary agent model
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=""
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"

# Anthropic, for vision tools
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com"

# OpenAI, for audio tools, intent recognition, and answer extraction
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"

# Gemini, for YouTube tasks
GEMINI_API_KEY=""

# Third party API keys
# For Google search and website scraping
SERPER_API_KEY=""
# For website scraping
JINA_API_KEY=""
# For the Linux sandbox
E2B_API_KEY=""

# [Optional] NewAPI, alternative to OpenRouter 
NEWAPI_API_KEY=""
NEWAPI_BASE_URL=""

# [Optional] for network proxy, null by default
HTTPS_PROXY=""
# [Optional] Data loading directory, by default `../../data`
DATA_DIR="../../data"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to use a different LLM as the primary agent model, you will need to provide the corresponding API keys.

### Step 3: Local E2B Sandbox Deployment
To achieve our best benchmark results, we recommend using a pre-defined sandbox template that includes the most commonly used Python and apt packages. Please see our [installation guide](docs/local_e2b.md) for detailed instructions.

If you prefer not to use a sandbox template, you can disable it by commenting out the line `template=DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_ID,` in `libs/miroflow-tool/src/miroflow/tool/mcp_servers/python_server.py` (line 145).


### Run a single task

```bash
## run a task with instruction
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent
uv run main.py trace --task="your task description" --task_file_name="path to related task file"
```

### Evaluate on Benchmark

Prepare datasets according to your requirements. Some datasets may need to be downloaded manually into the `/data/<benchmark>` folder, and you should also create a corresponding `standardized_data.jsonl` metafile. We will support as many datasets as possible as soon as we can.
```bash
## supported benchmarks
cd MiroFlow/apps/prepare-benchmark
uv run main.py get gaia-val
uv run main.py get browsecomp-test
uv run main.py get browsecomp-zh-test
uv run main.py get hle
```

Run evaluation using the default settings. (Not parallelized; not recommended.)
```bash
## run the code
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent
uv run main.py common-benchmark benchmark=gaia-validation
uv run main.py common-benchmark benchmark=browsecomp
uv run main.py common-benchmark benchmark=browsecomp-zh
uv run main.py common-benchmark benchmark=hle
```

For parallel and multi-run evaluations, and to gain better control over environment settings using Hydra, **we recommend using the provided script**:

```bash
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent
bash ./scripts/main-worker-dual/run_evaluate_multiple_runs_gaia-validation.sh
bash ./scripts/main-worker-dual/run_evaluate_multiple_runs_browsecomp.sh
bash ./scripts/main-worker-dual/run_evaluate_multiple_runs_browsecomp-zh.sh
bash ./scripts/main-worker-dual/run_evaluate_multiple_runs_hle.sh
```

You can easily modify and customize these scripts to suit your needs. See [Customized Configuration](#customized-configuration) for more details.

### Customized Configuration

MiroFlow leverages [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for powerful configuration management, allowing you to easily switch between different LLMs, agents, benchmarks, and pricing models using YAML configuration files. For detailed instructions on configuration management, see our [configuration guide](docs/hydra_config.md).
