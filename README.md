This repo is the official implementation of the MiroMind Research Agent Project. It is high-performance, fully open-source, and capable of conducting multi-step research on the internet to tackle complex tasks like future event prediction.  It currently includes 4 key components as follows:

ü§ñ **MiroFlow**: an open-source research agent framework that offers reproducible state-of-the-art performance on representative benchmarks (e.g., FutureX, GAIA, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and BrowserComp benchmarks), included in this repo. See [[Get Started in Under 5 Minutes]](#-get-started-in-under-5-minutes) for a quick start.

ü§î **MiroThinker**: an open-source agent foundation model that natively supports tool-assisted reasoning. See [MiroThinker](https://github.com/MiroMindAI/mirothinker).

üìä **MiroVerse**: 147k premium open-source training data supporting research agent training. See [MiroThinker](https://huggingface.co/datasets/miromind-ai/MiroVerse-v0.1).

üöß **MiroTrain / MiroRL**: The training infra that supports stable and efficient training for the research agent models. See [MiroTrain](https://github.com/MiroMindAI/MiroTrain) / [MiroRL](https://github.com/MiroMindAI/MiroRL)

## üöÄ Get Started in Under 5 Minutes

### üìã Prerequisites

**Python**: 3.12 or higher

**Package Manager**: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

**Operating System**: Linux, macOS

### ‚ö° Quick Setup

**Example**: Intelligent document analysis with file processing capabilities.

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/MiroMindAI/MiroFlow && cd MiroFlow
uv sync

# 2. Configure API key
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# 3. Run your first agent
uv run main.py trace --config_file_name=agent_quickstart_1 --task="What is the first country listed in the XLSX file that have names starting with Co?" --task_file_name="data/FSI-2023-DOWNLOAD.xlsx"
```

üéâ **Expected Output:** Your agent should return **\boxed{Congo Democratic Republic}** üòä

> **üí° Tip:** If you encounter issues, check that your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file and that all dependencies are installed.
