## üìù Introduction

<img src="docs/figs/logo.png" alt="MiroFlow Logo" width="150" align="right">


**MiroFlow** is a fully open-sourced agent framework that reliably completes complex tool-use tasks. Some key features are:

- üåü **Reproducible SOTA**: **MiroFlow** consistently achieves 72.2% (pass@1 average@3) on GAIA validation set. Follow our [getting-started guide](#get-start) below, or view our many runs of gaia trace on huggingfaces. If you can't reproduce our result, please open a Github issue - We take reproducibility seriously.
- üåü **High-quanlity Data Collection**: We enabled the agent workflow with data colleciton features to generate high-quality, post-training agent trace data. We also released partial data and model to public including [MiroThinker](https://huggingface.co/collections/miromind-ai/mirothinker-v01-689301b6d0563321862d44a1) and [MiroVerse](https://huggingface.co/datasets/miromind-ai/MiroVerse-v0.1).
- üåü **High Concurrency and Fault Tolerance**: **MiroFlow**  scales data collection efficiently and handles rate-limited APIs and unstable network connections with ease.
- üåü **Baked-in observability and evaluation**: **MiroFlow** ships with scripts for benchmarking agents and a straightforward web-ui for visualizing and debugging agent trace data.


## ‚ú® Performance on Benchmarks

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/figs/09xyHJV9dkbY2yacsv4zYTBbKM.avif" width="90%" alt="Comprehensive Benchmark Performance Comparison" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
</div>

We benchmark MiroFlow on a series of benchmarks including **GAIA**, **HLE**, **BrowseComp** and **xBench-DeepSearch**. Meantime, we are working on more benchmarks.

| Model/Framework | GAIA Val | HLE | HLE-Text | BrowserComp-EN | BrowserComp-ZH | xBench-DeepSearch |
|----------------|----------|-----|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **MiroFlow** | **82.4%** | **27.2%** | **29.5%** | 33.2% | **44.3%** | **72.0%** |

### GAIA-Validation

<img src="docs/figs/gaia_score.png" width="40%" alt="GAIA Validation Performance" align="right">

MiroFlow **achieved 81.8% pass@3, 82.4% maj. vote, 74.5% pass@1 (best@3), and 72.2% pass@1 (avg@3) on the GAIA validation set**. This represents **state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance** among open-source agent frameworks.

> [!NOTE]
> Our pass@1 scores are reported as both the average across three runs (avg@3) and the best score among those runs (best@3). For most other reported pass@1 results, it is unclear whether they represent an average or a best score across multiple trials (indicated with *). 

To prevent agents from retrieving answers directly from Hugging Face, we disabled access to it during the inference and trace collection.

*We have evaluated multiple agent frameworks on GAIA. Please note that some reported results may be overstated or lack clear definitions, and are not reproducible.*
In contrast, reproducing MiroFlow's results is straightforward with just a few required API keys.


# ü§ñ MiroFlow: Modular AI Agent Framework

MiroFlow is a sophisticated, modular framework for building intelligent AI agents with multi-turn conversation capabilities, comprehensive tool integration, and hierarchical sub-agent support.

# üöÄ Getting Started

## Prerequisites
> [!TIP]
> we recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) with `python>= 3.12` 

### Step 1: Clone repo and prepare python environment

```bash
## clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MiroMindAI/MiroFlow
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent

## prepare python environment
uv sync
```

### Step 2: Set up environment dependencies

#### a. Set up `MiroFlow/apps/prepare-benchmark/.env`

```bash
## copy environment variable template and prepare yours in .env file
cd MiroFlow/apps/prepare-benchmark

# Edit .env with your actual API keys
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure environment variables:

```env
# For downloading datasets from Hugging Face
HF_TOKEN="<your-huggingface-token>"

# [Optional] Data loading directory, by default `../../data`
DATA_DIR="../../data" # relative to this file 
```

#### b. Set up `MiroFlow/apps/run-agent/.env`

```bash
## copy environment variable template and prepare yours in .env file
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent

# Edit .env with your actual API keys
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure environment variables:

```env
# Using OpenRouter to provide primary agent model
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=""
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"

# Anthropic, for vision tools
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com"

# OpenAI, for audio tools, intent recognition, and answer extraction
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"

# Gemini, for YouTube tasks
GEMINI_API_KEY=""

# Third party API keys
# For Google search and website scraping
SERPER_API_KEY=""
# For website scraping
JINA_API_KEY=""
# For the Linux sandbox
E2B_API_KEY=""

# [Optional] NewAPI, alternative to OpenRouter 
NEWAPI_API_KEY=""
NEWAPI_BASE_URL=""

# [Optional] for network proxy, null by default
HTTPS_PROXY=""
# [Optional] Data loading directory, by default `../../data`
DATA_DIR="../../data"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to use a different LLM as the primary agent model, you will need to provide the corresponding API keys.

> [!TIP]
> **Optional Local E2B Sandbox**: If you prefer to use a local E2B Sandbox installation instead of the online service, please refer to our prepared [installation guide](docs/local_e2b.md).


### Run a single task

```bash
## run a task with instruction
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent
uv run main.py trace --task="your task description" --task_file_name="path to related task file"
```

### Evaluate on Benchmark

```bash
## download data
cd MiroFlow/apps/prepare-benchmark
uv run main.py get gaia-val
## run the code
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent
uv run main.py common-benchmark benchmark=gaia-validation
```

To perform parallel multi-run evaluations, you can use the provided script:

```bash
cd MiroFlow/apps/run-agent
bash scripts/claude-sonnet-3.7/run_evaluate_multiple_runs_gaia-validation.sh
```

### Customized Configuration

MiroFlow leverages [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for powerful configuration management, allowing you to easily switch between different LLMs, agents, benchmarks, and pricing models using YAML configuration files. For detailed instructions on configuration management, see our [configuration guide](docs/hydra_config.md).


## üåü MiroThinker

[MiroThinker](https://github.com/MiroMindAI/MiroThinker) (7B/14B/32B) is our suite of open-source agentic models, designed to work seamlessly with the MiroFlow framework. Our models are specifically built to handle **complex, multi-tool tasks**, leveraging the reproducible and robust foundation that MiroFlow provides.

By combining MiroFlow‚Äôs reliable orchestration with MiroThinker‚Äôs advanced reasoning capabilities, we offer a powerful, end-to-end solution for building high-performing, reproducible AI agents.
These models are a direct result of our extensive data collection efforts, utilizing MiroFlow to generate high-quality, post-training agent trace data. This unique approach enables MiroThinker to excel in planning, executing, and reasoning through complex multi-step tasks.
We invite the community to explore and build upon these models. For more details on the architecture and implementation, please take a look at our codebase.
