**Q: What is the estimated cost of running the GAIA validation set for a single run?** <br>
**A**: The cost is approximately **$450 USD** for a run without a cache. Enabling the cache can significantly reduce this cost by 50-67%, bringing it down to the **$150 - $225** range.


**Q: How long does it take to run the GAIA validation set for a single run?** <br>
**A**: With the `max_concurrent` parameter set to 20, a full run takes about **5 hours** to complete.

**Q: Are all the specified APIs required?** <br>
**A**: **Yes.** To fully reproduce our published results, access to all the listed APIs is necessary.


**Q: What is the difference between MiroFlow and MiroThinker?** <br>
**A**:  **MiroFlow** is primarily focused on interacting with proprietary models; **MiroThinker** is designed for our own open-source models.

We plan to merge these two projects in the future to create a single, unified platform.
