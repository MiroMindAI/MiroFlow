## ðŸŒŸ MiroThinker

[MiroThinker](https://github.com/MiroMindAI/MiroThinker) (7B/14B/32B) is our suite of open-source agentic models, designed to work seamlessly with the MiroFlow framework. Our models are specifically built to handle **complex, multi-tool tasks**, leveraging the reproducible and robust foundation that MiroFlow provides.

By combining MiroFlowâ€™s reliable orchestration with MiroThinkerâ€™s advanced reasoning capabilities, we offer a powerful, end-to-end solution for building high-performing, reproducible AI agents.
These models are a direct result of our extensive data collection efforts, utilizing MiroFlow to generate high-quality, post-training agent trace data. This unique approach enables MiroThinker to excel in planning, executing, and reasoning through complex multi-step tasks.
