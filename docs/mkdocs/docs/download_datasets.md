# Dataset Download Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before downloading the datasets, you need to:

1. **Request access to Hugging Face datasets**:
   - **GAIA Dataset**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaia-benchmark/GAIA
   - **HLE Dataset**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/hle

   Please visit these links and request access to the datasets.

2. **Configure environment variables**:

   Copy the template file and create your environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   Then edit the `.env` file and configure these two essential variables:

   ```env
   # Required: Your Hugging Face token for dataset access
   HF_TOKEN="your-actual-huggingface-token-here"
   
   # Data directory path 
   DATA_DIR="data/"
   ```

   To get your Hugging Face token:
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Create a new token with "Read" permissions
   - Replace `<your-huggingface-token>` in the `.env` file with your actual token
